# -100DaysofCode
My log for the #100DaysofCode challenge

### Day1
Created my github profile and just finished the second lesson in  FCC's Resposnive Web Design section. I'm feeling fairly comfortable with the basic concept of how index.html and styles.css works. I feel my brain works well with the slight problem solving I've been challenged with so far. I started the #100Devs free jobs program and coding bootcamp, and watched episode one. ATM learning the concept of "how to learn"

###Day 2
Started #100devs day 1 homework. currently working on a Coursera course. Nearly completed week 2. Started watching #100Devs ep. 2
