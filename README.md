# -100DaysofCode
My log for the #100DaysofCode challenge

### Day1
Created my github profile and just finished the second lesson in  FCC's Resposnive Web Design section. I'm feeling fairly comfortable with the concept of how index.html and styles.css works. I feel my brain works well with the slight problem solving I've been challenged with so far. I started the #100Devs free bootcamp and watched episode one. ATM learning the concept of "how to learn"

###Day 2
Started #100devs day 1 homework. currently working on a Coursera course. Nearly completed the course with only a little left to finish
