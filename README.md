# -100DaysofCode
My log for the #100DaysofCode challenge

### Day1
Created my github profile and just finished the second lesson in  FCC's Resposnive Web Design section. I'm feeling fairly comfortable with the basic concept of how index.html and styles.css works. I feel my brain works well with the slight problem solving I've been challenged with so far. I started the #100Devs free jobs program and coding bootcamp, and watched episode one. ATM learning the concept of "how to learn"

### Day2
Started #100devs day 1 homework. currently working on a Coursera course. Nearly completed week 2. Started watching #100Devs ep. 2

 ### Day3
 Finished #100Devs ep2. we worked on how to use tags correctly and semanticly. wrote out first bit of code. pretty much just practiced placing tags. hw is to read about html and css basics, make a BBC website front page, and continue corsera course on learning how to learn

 ### Day4
 reading and taking notes on shayhowe's html and css basics. started builing my first mockup website front page. i feel kinda comfortable with the basic concept of HTML but seem to be struggling with CSS and floats more. im really enjoying this so far and all i can think about is my bright future if i continue to put in the hard work
